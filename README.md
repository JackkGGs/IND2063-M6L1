# M6L1
Hello there. This is a simple code example where I examine a task from M1L2 and modify it to suit my needs. It includes two testing systems of the file-sending system inside the discord.py module available on PyPI WITH the addition of server-based image generation:

Image sending
Audio sending
API access
Thanks! Please don't hesitate to change this code to your needs.
